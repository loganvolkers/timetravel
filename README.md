# Time Travel

Demo of an algorithm for doing time-travel debugging of stateful jobs. Uses a simple map to let someone forecast the future.

This is mostly used as a teaching tool internally to help conceptualize how time-based programs can have unwanted side effect due to how time isn't encapsulated.
